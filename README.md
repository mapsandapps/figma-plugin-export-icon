# Figma Plugin: Export Icon

To compile:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

For dev, you may want to watch:

Hit ⌘⇧B (Ctrl-Shift-B for Windows) in Visual Studio Code, then select tsc: watch - tsconfig.json. This tells Visual Studio Code to compile code.ts into code.js. It will watch for changes to code.ts and automatically re-generate code.js every time code.ts is saved.

You may need to install Typescript first:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

And you may need to [install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) first.

Use the Figma desktop app and [import the plugin via the plugins menu](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/setup/).

Then you can run the plugin via the plugins menu or the quick actions menu.
